# NOE

This is NOE, a new event display for NOvA, with different design goals than
the existing event display.  To wit:

* Prioritize speed.  The primary goal of this display is to be able
  to rapidly (1) display a particular event or (2) browse a set of events.  NOE
  should be able to display at least 10 events per second over a remote X
  connection, provided compression is enabled and there is reasonable modern
  (2017) network connectivity.  Locally, it should be much faster.

* Allow visualizing events in new (useful) ways, including
  animations.

* Give easy access to detailed hit and reconstructed object information for
  displayed objects.

A non-exhaustive list of things that are not priorities:

* Replace the existing event display.  NOE is rather meant to be complementary.

* Use or display of detailed geometry.

* Have the ability to resize the display.

* Zooming.

* Be highly customizable, e.g. have user-adjustable colors.

* Have automatic availability of new types of reconstructed objects.  Most
  likely only a fixed list of the most commonly used objects will be available.

# Running it

nova -c noejob.fcl <art file>

The art file must have calibrated hits in it, i.e. rb::CellHits with the
label "calhit".  NOE does not run on artdaq files.

# Name

It's the "New nOva Event display", just to drive people crazy who try to get
"NOvA" written consistently.  No, actually the reason is that I wrote a similar
event display for Double Chooz called ZOE, the "Zeroth Outer veto Event
display", and this is the NOvA port of it, N-ZOE, or NOE for short.

"NOE" is also the nuclear Overhauser effect, which sounds cool, but has nothing
to do with NOvA, as well as the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event, which has
even less to do with NOvA.
